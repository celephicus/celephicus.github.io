It had a slightly complicated gestation.
I Nearly Make a Table&amp;hellip; I initially made a circular frame for sitting a piece of tempered glass into. I made the frame from strip steel on a machine called a Ring Roller, that passes the work over two undriven rollers in a row with a third driven roller pressing down on the work, so by repeated passes it forms a perfect circle (apart from the ends, which remain straight as they can&amp;rsquo;t go through the machine).</description></item><item><title>Sign for Footscray Maker Lab</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/fml-sign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/fml-sign/</guid><description>FML Sign was a sign for the shared studio space &amp;ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&amp;rdquo; or FML in inner Melbourne.

It was an interesting experience at a difficult personal time, and certainly gave me something else to think about.</description></item><item><title>I Made It Myself</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/i-made-it-myself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/i-made-it-myself/</guid><description>I made I Made It Myself for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2022. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Messages of Hope&amp;rdquo; and the direction was to make a mailbox. I was rather pleased that I got first prize, here&amp;rsquo;s me &amp;amp; the Mayor Paula Wreidt at the opening.
Materials The box is made of scrap clear acrylic glued together. I have yet to find a good glue for acrylic, even bathroom silicone (the sort that smells like ants) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold very well.</description></item></channel></rss>

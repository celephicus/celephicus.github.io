I made the hull out of abroken upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item><item><title>I Made It Myself</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</guid><description>I made I Made It Myself for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2022. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Messages of Hope&amp;rdquo; and the direction was to make a mailbox. I was rather pleased that I got first prize, heres me &amp;amp; the Mayor Paula Wreidt at the opening.
Materials The box is made of scrap clear acrylic glued together. I have yet to find a good glue for acrylic, even bathroom silicone (the sort that smells like ants) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold very well.</description></item><item><title>Miss New Zealand</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</guid><description>Miss New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s name was inspired by the mascot for the Sydney Mardi Gras one year, who was a 1950&amp;rsquo;s young lady in twinset &amp;amp; pearls, who obviously never went out without her coat, hat and gloves.
The starting point was the novelty Harrods branded padlock, it was an obvious handbag. Her body is a trailer plug, arms from a gas lighter and hands are electrical terminals. Her shoes are also some sort of electrical clippy thing.</description></item><item><title>The Reader</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</guid><description>The Reader is just made to sit on a shelf and keeps very much to herself (I always think of it as a &amp;ldquo;her&amp;rdquo;). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what shes made of, just some rusty iron I picked up, I do remember being inspired by the wonderful textures that rust gives to iron after a few years or decades.
Her legs are a pair of hinges from an old Singer sewing machine that allowed it to fold away into the wooden base.</description></item><item><title>404</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/404.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/404.html</guid><description>Broken link :(</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/about/</guid><description>Portrait with robot Working on Fragments About I don&amp;rsquo;t normally write about myself in the passive voice (i.e without using the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; pronoun) it seems strangely odd and distances myself from I, and creates a sense of unreality.
Bio Tom has been fascinated by machinery for as long as he can remember. Especially old, obsolete machinery, unloved, just short of the junk pile. Usually this fascination involved taking it apart.</description></item></channel></rss>

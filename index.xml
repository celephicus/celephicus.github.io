Astrid was an attempt to make a sister for Celeste, but I never managed to get the oscillating mechanism working reliably. So I used the armature from an induction motor as the base, nice and heavy and an interesting design without overwhelming the figure.</description></item><item><title>Aurora</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/aurora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/aurora/</guid><description>Details Size: height 40cm; base 20cm x 20cm.

Art From Trash Aurora was made for the annual &amp;ldquo;Art From Trash&amp;rdquo; art show in 2023 at the Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre, Hobart. Organised by South Hobart Tip Shop, perhaps the premier tip shop in the state, though Mornington is pretty good as well.</description></item><item><title>Celeste Goes Dancing</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/celeste-goes-dancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/celeste-goes-dancing/</guid><description>Celeste Goes Dancing Size: base 17cm x 17cm; height 40cm.

Celeste Goes Dancing was my earliest attempt at a kinetic (moving) sculpture. The name comes from a book of South American fantastic short stories that I owned when I was into the magical realism style, I remember nothing about the book apart that it was my introduction to the wonder of Jorge Luis Borges, so it deserves to be memorialised.</description></item><item><title>Coffee Table</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/coffee-table/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/coffee-table/</guid><description>One of my massive furniture pieces. I needed a coffee table for my flat, and just be a happy coincidence there was a large truck motor hanging around at my shared studio space &amp;ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&amp;rdquo; or FML; as so often happens in such places some tenant had acquired an item and then left, usually owing rent, so their abandoned items just hung around taking up space. It was mounted on a heavy trolley so that it could be moved with difficulty as it weighed half a ton at least.</description></item><item><title>Domestic Goddess</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/domestic-goddess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/domestic-goddess/</guid><description>Domestic Goddess Height: 37cm
Materials: Coffee pot, lamp parts, glass beads, curtain rings, table forks.
Date: 2016
Domestic Goddess is a piece of folk art, so like all such she&amp;rsquo;s not particularly original, you will find plenty like her out there in internet land. Folk art endlessly reuses motifs: Domestic Goddess' hands are table forks and she lives in a piece of retro kitchenalia. My kids really used to like that her earrings are curtain rings; a favourite movie was Planes, Trains and Automobiles where John Candy&amp;rsquo;s character makes quick money peddling shower curtain rings to various people, telling two young teens girls that as earrings &amp;ldquo;You know something?</description></item><item><title>Fish Away: Nature Transforms</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</guid><description>Size: width 60cm, height 40cm, depth 9cm.

I regret the wanky title, the piece was made for the Dandenong Ranges Artists Open Studios Exhibition 2019, and they chose the theme &amp;ldquo;Alchemy&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Iron Mirror 1</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/iron-mirror-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/iron-mirror-1/</guid><description>Iron Mirror 1 is a model for a piece that I never completed. It had a slightly complicated gestation.
I Nearly Make a Table&amp;hellip; I initially made a circular frame for sitting a piece of tempered glass into. I made the frame from strip steel on a machine called a Ring Roller, that passes the work over two undriven rollers in a row with a third driven roller pressing down on the work, so by repeated passes it forms a perfect circle (apart from the ends, which remain straight as they can&amp;rsquo;t go through the machine).</description></item><item><title>Sign for Footscray Maker Lab</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/fml-sign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/fml-sign/</guid><description>FML Sign was a sign for the shared studio space &amp;ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&amp;rdquo; or FML in inner Melbourne. Situated in a semi-derelict warehouse that the owners only leased to us as I suspect no-one else would rent it. It was a noted rave venue in the 90s, and there was plenty of graffiti in the place, but even the ravers thought it too shabby and moved on. It was an interesting experience at a difficult personal time, and certainly gave me something else to think about.</description></item><item><title>Sound Wave</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/sound-wave/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/sound-wave/</guid><description>Sound Wave was easily my biggest and heaviest sculpture, 2.4m high and over 250Kg as that&amp;rsquo;s where my scale stops! Like most of my ideas the actual result differed from the concept.
My concept was inspired by a fern shoot bursting through the ground. It always amazes me how something as soft as a fern shoot can break through hard earth and push through layers of packed bark and forest trash considering that it is about the strength of an asparagas stalk.</description></item><item><title>Still Ahead</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/still-ahead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/still-ahead/</guid><description>Details Size: 30cm wide x 40cm high wall hanging; 30cmm deep.

The inspiritational moment for me was when I picked up an old Sunbeam brand cake mixer on hard rubbish, and then I dropped it and broke off the handle, which was made of brittle bakelite. I then removed the handle, and the hole in the top looked like a cockpit, with the lovely 50s design of the mixer forming the body of a retro-futuristic vehicle.</description></item><item><title>Good Ship Hobo</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</guid><description>The Good Ship Hobo was a collaboration with Claude Ciccione of Belgrave. I made the hull out of an upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item><item><title>I Made It Myself</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/i-made-it-myself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/fragments/i-made-it-myself/</guid><description>Details Size: 30cm wide x 40cm high wall hanging; 30cmm deep.

Salvaged Art Exhibition Kingston 2021 I made I Made It Myself for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2021.

The starting point was the novelty Harrods branded padlock, it was an obvious handbag. Her body is a trailer plug, arms from a gas lighter and hands are electrical terminals. Her shoes are also some sort of electrical clippy thing.</description></item><item><title>My Happy Place</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/my-happy-place/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/my-happy-place/</guid><description>Details Size: 50cm x 50cm x 60cm high.

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what she&amp;rsquo;s made of, just some rusty iron I picked up, I do remember being inspired by the wonderful textures that rust gives to iron after a few years or decades.
Her legs are a pair of hinges from an old Singer sewing machine that allowed it to fold away into the wooden base.</description></item><item><title>404</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/404.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/404.html</guid><description>Broken link :(</description></item><item><title>about</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/about/</guid><description>Portrait with robot Working on Fragments Bio Tom has been fascinated by machinery for as long as he can remember. Especially old, obsolete machinery, unloved, just short of the junk pile. Usually this fascination involved taking it apart.

<p><strong>The Reader</strong> is just made to sit on a shelf and keeps very much to herself (I always think of it as a &ldquo;her&rdquo;). I&rsquo;m not sure what she&rsquo;s made of, just some rusty iron I picked up, I do remember being inspired by the wonderful textures that rust gives to iron after a few years or decades.</p>
<p>Her legs are a pair of hinges from an old Singer sewing machine that allowed it to fold away into the wooden base.</p>

<p><strong>The Good Ship Hobo</strong> was a collaboration with Claude Ciccione of Belgrave. I made the hull out of an upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits & pieces.</p>
<p>Heres a shot of the complete display I made for the show.
<img src=/images/works/groups/20170115_175807.jpg alt="Show display"></p>
<p>And here are some work in progress shots taken on a dull day at Claude&rsquo;s house in Belgrave.</p>

<p>Since The Good Ship Hobo sold (my biggest sale!) at the show I don&rsquo;t have any better photos. I installed LEDs inside the hull which shone out of the portholes so she looked fantastic in subdued lighting, like a real ship. I hope she went to a good home.</p>

<p>I made <strong>I Made It Myself</strong> for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2022. The theme was &ldquo;Messages of Hope&rdquo; and the direction was to make a mailbox. I was rather pleased that I got first prize, here&rsquo;s me & the Mayor Paula Wreidt at the opening.</p>
<p><img src=/images/works/i-made-it-myself/IMG20211112182946.jpg alt=mayor></p>
<h2 id=materials>Materials</h2>
<p>The box is made of scrap clear acrylic glued together. I have yet to find a good glue for acrylic, even bathroom silicone (the sort that smells like ants) doesn&rsquo;t seem to hold very well. I probably should have sanded it first. I&rsquo;ve fixed it a few times.
Onto this I glued lots of fragments from my bits box, including fragments of a barbie doll, like the arms and the bum. The kids liked that bit and none of them found it creepy. On top there&rsquo;s a little man putting the finishing touches to his creation. He&rsquo;s quite proud that he built it himself, out of junk.
The lightshow inside is made from a string of LEDs from Aliexpress that I bought to make a desklamp, unfortunately they were far too dim and they are incapable of producing a white light that does not give a headache. However they are perfect for a gentle lightshow if the colour is dialed down a bit. I used a cheap little microcontroller to drive the LED string, its got about enough brains to run a toaster so it can do a dozen LEDs no problem.</p>

<p><strong>Miss New Zealand</strong>&rsquo;s name was inspired by the mascot for the Sydney Mardi Gras one year, who was a 1950&rsquo;s young lady in twinset & pearls, who obviously never went out without her coat, hat and gloves.</p>
<p>The starting point was the novelty Harrods branded padlock, it was an obvious handbag. Her body is a trailer plug, arms from a gas lighter and hands are electrical terminals. Her shoes are also some sort of electrical clippy thing. Her hat is a brass nut from a plumbing fitting.</p>
<p>I was pleases that she actually balances on her feet, its quite tricky to get this right, which is why so many of my pieces repose on plinths and podia.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a lineup with a couple of other small figures.

<p>Also appearing are the Oyster Rabbit and a funny apple that looked to me like a cartoon Chinaman so I made him a hat.</p>

<p><strong>FML Sign</strong> was a sign for the shared studio space &ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&rdquo; or <a href=https://footscraymakerlab.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>FML</a> in inner Melbourne. Situated in a semi-derelict warehouse that the owners' only leased to us as I suspect no-one else would rent it. It was a noted rave venue in the 90s, and there was plenty of graffiti in the place, but even the ravers thought it too shabby and moved on. It was an interesting experience at a difficult personal time, and certainly gave me something else to think about.</p>
<p>The sign was intended to go on the roof on a wire fence that had once contained the building&rsquo;s electrical supply, backlit with red diffused light (shades of Dark Mofo?), but it ended up being fixed to a wall in the yard. I don&rsquo;t have a good photo of it now. I still think it would look fantastic backlit.</p>
<p>I built the frame freehand with strap iron, and then infilled with the most lightweight bits of steel that I could find. I think I got a good selection of shapes. I used fluxcore wire in the MIG, as it makes a good weld even through paint or plating. I know that welding through plating is a bad idea as the fumes can make you sick as a dog so please don&rsquo;t tell me.</p>
<p>Looks like I sharpened this photo up a bit, the place rarely looked that clean!</p>

<p><strong>Sunbeam</strong> was a long time in the making. The inspiritational piece for mewas when I picked up an old Sunbeam brand cake mixer on hard rubbish, and then I dropped it and broke off the handle, which was made of brittle bakelite. I then removed the handle, and the hole in the top looked like a cockpit, with the lovely 50s design of the mixer forming the body of a retro-futuristic vehicle. Somehow a pair of wheels from the nozzle of a garden blower got fitted, and a single trailing wheel that came from a sewing machine.</p>
<p>But there it stalled, as I wanted a figure in the cockpit, and I could never find one&mldr; until years later I found a fairly hideous doll which I&rsquo;m told is a &ldquo;Bratz&rdquo;, and the legs came off and she became a cyborg, a post-human creature. Since I am a fan of Studio Ghibli movies I made a little propellor out of a brass valve because anything can fly if it has a propellor.</p>
<p>I left her sitting on my bench at my shared studio space at Footscray Maker Lab, and Emily the caretaker wandered by. She loved Sunbeam and added her own vision of a leopard print crop top and a hairdo using industrial strength hair lacquer made specially for punks.</p>
<p>Since then Sunbeam has always been around my house, a little ray of sushine with a heart of gold if you can get over the miniature-cyborg-punk-doll vibe.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Emily in her caravan and succulent garden.</p>

<p><strong>Iron Mirror 1</strong> is a model for a piece that I never completed. It had a slightly complicated gestation.</p>
<h2 id=i-nearly-make-a-table>I Nearly Make a Table&mldr;</h2>
<p>I initially made a circular frame for sitting a piece of tempered glass into. I made the frame from strip steel on a machine called a Ring Roller, that passes the work over two undriven rollers in a row with a third driven roller pressing down on the work, so by repeated passes it forms a perfect circle (apart from the ends, which remain straight as they can&rsquo;t go through the machine). Then you cut the unbent ends off and weld it together to form a ring. The machine was very heavily built and hard work as it was completely manual. I have since found that I can make a perfectly acceptable ring by just tying two round fenceposts together, and passing the steel over it whilst an assistant hits the steel over the gap in the middle with a sledgehammer. It&rsquo;s a bit tricky to keep things straight so that the ring isn&rsquo;t twisted, but not too difficult, and the ring can always be twisted or bashed into shape.</p>
<p>Then I infilled the ring with lots of iron scrap bolts and engine parts. I first burned the grease and plating off them in a homemade forge powered with a leafblower, and then cleaned them up in a cement mixer with a slurry of beachsand. One side of the infill I kept very flat as it was going to have the glass resting on it, whilst I welded the bits on the other side. I used fluxcore wire in the MIG welder. It&rsquo;s easier than using sticks where you need to strike the arc before welding, which usually moves little bits like bolts etc. which are not clamped together. Also fluxcore gives better welds on dirty metal, as after cleaning the bolts are bright steel which goes rusty very quickly.</p>
<p><img src=/images/works/iron-mirror-proto/20230729_144419.rotated.jpg alt="Infill detail"></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really do a design, just filled it with whatever I had to hand, as I was just trying out how it looked. I found that nuts & bolts can easily be formed into all sorts of designs, suggesting stars or flowers, and were easy to bend as their soak in the forge had removed the hardness / toughness of the steel. Other design elements can be realised with odd bits of scrap, but I mostly had nuts & bolts.</p>
<p>But then I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the look of the design, so I never built the table, just kept the top lying around.</p>
<p>Years later I was doing a local art event &ldquo;Art in the Hills&rdquo; which is a huge open studios weekend for lots of artists around the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne. As I was new to the event the organisers assigned me a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; <a href=https://jessiejournoudryan.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Jessie Jornaud-Ryan</a>, who makes sculptural mosaic pieces from broken crockery that are really worth a look, particularly birds, I have one of her wrens in the kitchen. She did a walkround of my workspace, and I showed her the tabletop, and asked for suggestions, she suggested mounting it on a pedestal.</p>
<h2 id=aside-vortex-cannon>Aside: Vortex Cannon</h2>
<p><img src=/images/works/vortex-cannon/DSC_0475.JPG alt="Operating the VortexCannon"></p>
<p>I happened to have made a large U shaped mount for my vortex cannon (a machine that launches smoke rings when whacked with a largemallet) which I made after observing ihe trials of savant <a href=https://www.ibys.org/index.php/2016/03/08/second-prototype-of-toroidal-ring-vortex-machine-undergoing-trials/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Mark Thomson&rsquo;s giant cannon</a>, allegedly a Nazi secret weapon, cunningly disguised as a tin water tank. I had junked the cannon since I had nowhere to store it, but I still had the mount, consisting of a large U on a central axis, that could swivel horizontally and vertically. It was easy to fit the round panel in the mount, and I knew that I had something.</p>
<h2 id=the-mirror>The Mirror</h2>
<p>It is extraordinarily satisfying to look at (or <em>through</em> or <em>into</em>?) the Mirror, and to turn it to different positions. I certainly enjoy having it around, and the visitors on the weekend of my open studio were intrigued with it. I still have it, and visitors still stop to admire it. Of particular interest is the two sides to the mirror, with the design mirrored of course, but one clear of welds, the other chockers with spotwelds. Of course the mirror world is only an <em>approximate</em> copy of our world&mldr;</p>
<p>I really should make the final version of this piece, with a properly engineered mount with some sort of bearing rather than unlubricated metal on metal, and a nice design for the Mirror.</p>

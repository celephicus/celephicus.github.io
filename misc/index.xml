Domestic Goddess is a piece of folk art, so like all such she&amp;rsquo;s not particularly original, you will find plenty like her out there in internet land. Folk art endlessly reuses motifs: Domestic Goddess' hands are table forks and she lives in a piece of retro kitchenalia. My kids really used to like that her earrings are curtain rings; a favourite movie was Planes, Trains and Automobiles where John Candy&amp;rsquo;s character makes quick money peddling shower curtain rings to various people, telling two young teens girls that as earrings &amp;ldquo;You know something?</description></item><item><title>Fish Away: Nature Transforms</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</guid><description>Size: width 60cm, height 40cm, depth 9cm.

The inspiritational piece for mewas when I picked up an old Sunbeam brand cake mixer on hard rubbish, and then I dropped it and broke off the handle, which was made of brittle bakelite. I then removed the handle, and the hole in the top looked like a cockpit, with the lovely 50s design of the mixer forming the body of a retro-futuristic vehicle.</description></item><item><title>Good Ship Hobo</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</guid><description>The Good Ship Hobo was a collaboration with Claude Ciccione of Belgrave. I made the hull out of an upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item></channel></rss>

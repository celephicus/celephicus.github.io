Astrid was an attempt to make a sister for Celeste, but I never managed to get the oscillating mechanism working reliably. So I used the armature from an induction motor as the base, nice and heavy and an interesting design without overwhelming the figure.</description></item><item><title>Aurora</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/aurora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/aurora/</guid><description>Details Size: height 40cm; base 20cm x 20cm.

Art From Trash Aurora was made for the annual &amp;ldquo;Art From Trash&amp;rdquo; art show in 2023 at the Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre, Hobart. Organised by South Hobart Tip Shop, perhaps the premier tip shop in the state, though Mornington is pretty good as well.</description></item><item><title>Celeste Goes Dancing</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/celeste-goes-dancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/celeste-goes-dancing/</guid><description>Celeste Goes Dancing Size: base 17cm x 17cm; height 40cm.

Celeste Goes Dancing was my earliest attempt at a kinetic (moving) sculpture. The name comes from a book of South American fantastic short stories that I owned when I was into the magical realism style, I remember nothing about the book apart that it was my introduction to the wonder of Jorge Luis Borges, so it deserves to be memorialised.</description></item><item><title>Miss New Zealand</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</guid><description>Miss New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s name was inspired by the mascot for the Sydney Mardi Gras one year, who was a 1950&amp;rsquo;s young lady in twinset &amp;amp; pearls, who obviously never went out without her coat, hat and gloves.
The starting point was the novelty Harrods branded padlock, it was an obvious handbag. Her body is a trailer plug, arms from a gas lighter and hands are electrical terminals. Her shoes are also some sort of electrical clippy thing.</description></item><item><title>The Reader</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</guid><description>The Reader is just made to sit on a shelf and keeps very much to herself (I always think of it as a &amp;ldquo;her&amp;rdquo;). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what she&amp;rsquo;s made of, just some rusty iron I picked up, I do remember being inspired by the wonderful textures that rust gives to iron after a few years or decades.
Her legs are a pair of hinges from an old Singer sewing machine that allowed it to fold away into the wooden base.</description></item></channel></rss>

I needed a coffee table for my flat, and just be a happy coincidence there was a large truck motor hanging around at my shared studio space &amp;ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&amp;rdquo; or FML; as so often happens in such places some tenant had acquired an item and then left, usually owing rent, so their abandoned items just hung around taking up space. It was mounted on a heavy trolley so that it could be moved with difficulty as it weighed half a ton at least.</description></item><item><title>Domestic Goddess</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/domestic-goddess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/domestic-goddess/</guid><description>Domestic Goddess Height: 37cm

Domestic Goddess is a piece of folk art, so like all such she&amp;rsquo;s not particularly original, you will find plenty like her out there in internet land. Folk art endlessly reuses motifs: Domestic Goddess' hands are table forks and she lives in a piece of retro kitchenalia. My kids really used to like that her earrings are curtain rings; a favourite movie was Planes, Trains and Automobiles where John Candy&amp;rsquo;s character makes quick money peddling shower curtain rings to various people, telling two young teens girls that as earrings &amp;ldquo;You know something?</description></item><item><title>Fish Away: Nature Transforms</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/fish-away/</guid><description>Size: width 60cm, height 40cm, depth 9cm.

The inspiritational moment for me was when I picked up an old Sunbeam brand cake mixer on hard rubbish, and then I dropped it and broke off the handle, which was made of brittle bakelite. I then removed the handle, and the hole in the top looked like a cockpit, with the lovely 50s design of the mixer forming the body of a retro-futuristic vehicle.</description></item><item><title>Good Ship Hobo</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/good-ship-hobo/</guid><description>The Good Ship Hobo was a collaboration with Claude Ciccione of Belgrave. I made the hull out of an upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item><item><title>My Happy Place</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/my-happy-place/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/my-happy-place/</guid><description>Details Size: 50cm x 50cm x 60cm high.

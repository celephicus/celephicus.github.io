I made the hull out of abroken upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item><item><title>I Made It Myself</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</guid><description>I made I Made It Myself for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2022. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Messages of Hope&amp;rdquo; and the direction was to make a mailbox. I was rather pleased that I got first prize, heres me &amp;amp; the Mayor Paula Wreidt at the opening.
Materials The box is made of scrap clear acrylic glued together. I have yet to find a good glue for acrylic, even bathroom silicone (the sort that smells like ants) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold very well.</description></item></channel></rss>

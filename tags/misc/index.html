<p><strong>The Good Ship Hobo</strong> was a collaboration with Claude Ciccione of Belgrave. I made the hull out of an upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits & pieces.</p>
<p>Heres a shot of the complete display I made for the show.
<img src=/images/works/groups/20170115_175807.jpg alt="Show display"></p>
<p>And here are some work in progress shots taken on a dull day at Claude&rsquo;s house in Belgrave.</p>

<p>Since The Good Ship Hobo sold (my biggest sale!) at the show I don&rsquo;t have any better photos. I installed LEDs inside the hull which shone out of the portholes so she looked fantastic in subdued lighting, like a real ship. I hope she went to a good home.</p>

<p>One of my massive furniture pieces. I needed a coffee table for my flat, and just be a happy coincidence there was a large truck motor hanging around at my shared studio space &ldquo;Footscray Maker Lab&rdquo; or <a href=https://footscraymakerlab.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>FML</a>; as so often happens in such places some tenant had acquired an item and then left, usually owing rent, so their abandoned items just hung around taking up space. It was mounted on a heavy trolley so that it could be moved with difficulty as it weighed half a ton at least. The trolley had 4 lovely industrial wheels, so I offered to take it to the scrapyard, if I could have the wheels.</p>
<p>The top was an ironbark sleeper that I found on hard rubbish. Ironbark is a timber that it very resistant to rot; like redgum it grows in swamps so is often used for outdoor uses like retaining walls or similar. The sleeper had quite a lot of sapwood (soft wood that rots very quickly) so I just removed the crumbly bits with a wire brush then stabilised it with dilute poyurethane varnish. I chopped the sleeper into 4 pieces then fixed them all side by side, using threaded rods to tie them together: no fine woodworking skills here. Truing the top was a real chore, ironbark is hard as nails and like redgum the grain seems to go in random directions. Historically it was used green (unseasoned) as it was too much like hard work to cut it dry. I ended up using a planer with a carbide blade and then a large belt sander.</p>
<p>I cut up the trolley and rewelded it to suit the top. One day I should replace the bent bits of fencing wire that hold on the wheels with proper split pins.</p>
<p>The finish is my favourite universal finish: beeswax & turpentine. It goes just as well on steel or wood, polishes up a treat and it very easy to refinish if it gets marks. Despite taking very little care with it I have never had to refinish it.</p>
<p>Of course it it very heavy, probably 100Kg or so. But since it is on wheels it is easy to move around. It will last forever.</p>

<h1 id=domestic-goddess>Domestic Goddess</h1>
<p>Height: 37cm<br>
Materials: Coffee pot, lamp parts, glass beads, curtain rings, table forks.<br>
Date: 2016</p>
<p><strong>Domestic Goddess</strong> is a piece of folk art, so like all such she&rsquo;s not particularly original, you will find plenty like her out there in internet land. Folk art endlessly reuses motifs: Domestic Goddess' hands are table forks and she lives in a piece of retro kitchenalia. My kids really used to like that her earrings are curtain rings; a favourite movie was <em>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</em> where John Candy&rsquo;s character makes quick money peddling shower curtain rings to various people, telling two young teens girls that as earrings &ldquo;You know something? It makes you look a little older, too. I mean not just a little bit. You could pass for 18 or 19.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s a happy thing to brighten a dull corner; or a dull day.</p>
<p><img src=/images/works/domestic-goddess/DSC_0493.JPG alt="with a flower"></p>
<p>She used to have a flower but it got lost, I think she looks fine without it. I just made her when I found the old enamel coffee pot and the brass bit of a lamp that I turned into a hat. The other parts are just stuff I had to hand.</p>

<p>Size: width 60cm, height 40cm, depth 9cm.
Materials: Antique cast iron fragment, purpose unknown, 1950’s aluminium lamp shade, Victorian shoe tree, plumber’s snake, vintage indicator lamp, fused plastic bags, scrap timber, acrylic sheet from White Night artwork; all recycled. RGB LED strip & programmable controller from Aliexpress.
Date: 2018, 2019.
Note: requires a USB socket for power, such as a USB charger</p>
<p>I regret the wanky title, the piece was made for the <strong>Dandenong Ranges Artists Open Studios Exhibition 2019</strong>, and they chose the theme &ldquo;Alchemy&rdquo;. I remember I stood up in the meeting and asked them what it meant, of course no-one knew, basically the whole alchemy thing was a con to get money from the deluded, it achieved nothing and derailed science progress for centuries.</p>
<p>Heres my Artist&rsquo;s Statement:</p>
<pre><code>Alchemy was a historical failed attempt at understanding the process of transformation in Nature. From our current behaviour it would seem that we have not learned anything better. We use our beautiful planet at a dumping ground for our waste. What happens if Nature decides to fight back, to do a transformation, to use our rubbish to create a new order of life? I don’t think she’s very happy with us.
</code></pre>
<p>As usual I was inspired by the wonderful patina on the cast iron fragment that forms the body. I picked it up on holiday somewhere from an old rubbish heap outside a ruined cottage, I still have no idea what it was once a part of. After cleaning it of loose rust and lacquering it to stop it rusting further, I decided it was part of a fish, so I needed a tail and a head to complete it. The tail was part of a very old rusty metal shoe tree, a contrivance that was inserted into a good pair of shoes to keep the shape. The head was anothe lampshade, a mainstay of mine, I love old lamp parts, they are so versatile and wonderful shapes.</p>
<p>The tail was made from pieces of a long metal spring (picturesquely called a &ldquo;drain snake&rdquo;) made to clean out blocked pipes, and plastic shopping bags from Coles I think that I fused several layers together with an iron between layers of baking paper. The whole mess was washed with very dilute acrylic paint and sprinkled with flour to give it an antique look, as the plastic looked far too new & shiny.</p>
<p>The eye is made from a wonderful antique indicator lamp from <em>somewhere</em>, that I just added a red LED inside that fades up & down, this effect is termed &ldquo;breathing&rdquo; for some reason.<br>
I got a friend to paint a mouth inspired by the designs on fighter aircraft, I don&rsquo;t really like the result, though he did a great job. He used oil paint which of course refused to dry on metal, I had to put it in the oven to get it even tacky, then I lacquered it. I feel it was a cop-out not doing it all myself. Marcel Duchamp employed a signwriter on his famous urinal, but he was a real artist!</p>
<h2 id=the-lightshow>The Lightshow</h2>
<p>The whole thing is quite heavy, and I mounted it on a sheet of while acrylic that I recycled from the huge sign that was made for White Night in Melbourne years ago and stored at the shared studio I rented in Footscray until they scrapped it. I <em>am</em> proud of the lightshow that I devised for behind the acrylic. I bought a strip of LEDs that you can control the colour of each LED in the string, there must be about 60 of them, I think I put 3 length in the box. These were controlled by a tiny toy computer called an <a href=https://www.arduino.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Arduino</a>, that is claimed to reduce programming to the point that it is accessable to creative types who are not engineers. THe hardware is a little circuit board that can control just about anything electronic. It is programmed with an app that runs on a PC that downloads the code to the Arduino, that can then just run it when it is turned on. It succeeds fairly well, I was able the program the strips to display random blobs that change colour very slowly. The range of colours is carefully chosen to be unsaturated colours, not the normal garish hues that coloured LEDs display, and to be biased towards the green/blue end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Thanks to this project I actually learnt how to apply a way of representing colours in the &ldquo;hue-saturation-value&rdquo; (HSV) space, rather then the &ldquo;red-green-blue&rdquo; (RGB) space. HSV defines a colour as its &ldquo;hue&rdquo; or colour, similar to the artist&rsquo;s colour wheel; the &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; which is how bright or pastel the colour is; and the &ldquo;value&rdquo; or brightness. It is very intuitive to generate colour values in HSV, and to adjust them until they are what you are looking for. For more just google for &ldquo;HSV&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I also learnt a great lesson: anything that includes LEDs should have a brightness control. You never know what it will look like until it is installed, it may be in a drak corner or under spotlights. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to conceal it a bit, to prevent fiddling. The Arduino makes it easy to use a simple rotart control like a volume knob on a radio to control overall brightness, I made mine only accessable with a screwdriver through a little hole.</p>
<p>Embarassingly for a professional software engineer I seem to have lost the code somewhere along the way, but it was very short, only about 30 lines or so. I started with a demo project included with the Arduino software, and then just played with it until it looks like what I wanted.</p>

<h3 id=art-from-trash>Art From Trash</h3>
<p><strong>Still Ahead</strong> was made for the annual &ldquo;Art From Trash&rdquo; art show in 2023 at the Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre, Hobart. Organised by South Hobart Tip Shop, perhaps the premier tip shop in the state, though Mornington is pretty good as well.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the artist&rsquo;s description I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>Years ago I picked up an old coffeepot with broken legs and spout from the scrap yard. I just
liked the shape and used it for incense. Then it went to the shed for a while, until it 
happened to come together with the ball thing from an old lamp. Still Ahead was alive!
It didn't take long to find ears and horns, all sorts of things will do the job. I needed 
new tongs for the barbie anyway. 
The eyes took a bit longer to get right. They are big marbles glued into some sort of 
electrical plug bit from Margate tip shop. My happy place, me &amp; my partner went on our 
first date there! An old tea tray and a mystery aluminium wreath from the tip shop make 
a fine plaque.
Some Christmas lights, an old phone charger and bits from my big box of electrical junk 
make the eyes light up.
</code></pre>
<h3 id=the-story>The Story</h3>
<p>As I was entering <a href=/works/figures/aurora>Aurora</a> in the show as well I wanted to do another piece, but was a bit stuck. Then inspiration arrived from the usual source: the Shed. I was looking through a box of old pots and bits and I found the broken brass jug that forms the top of the head, and then I found a ball shaped bit that fitted perfectly in the mouth of the jug, making a perfect mouth, I think it was part of a standard lamp. Instant head! I&rsquo;ve made a few trophy heads over the years, so I thought that I&rsquo;d make another, as they are a bit folk-arty, variations on a theme: onto a head goes horns and ears, and some eyes, the whole lot mounted on something flat.</p>
<h3 id=description>Description</h3>
<p>The two head parts are put together with a spring, which means that the mouth bit is movable side to side, which gives a small variety of expressions. The mouth also makes an admirable card dispenser. The silver spot on the head is where the handle was soldered to, but looks like it belongs there.
The horns were made for the ends of fancy curtain rods and do the job very well. The ears were from an old rusty set of tongs.</p>
<p>The silver eye surrounds are plumbing fittings: they hide the mess where a pipe goes through the wall. The eyeballs are old worn glass marbles glued into some sort of electrical fitting. Behind the marbles are more of my colour changing LEDs. They are controlled by the large switch on the bottom of the plaque, with a fairly unnecessary bit of flexible metal conduit for a bit of a steampunk look.
The plaque is an old tea tray, with an aluminium wreath from somewhere bolted on.</p>

<p>Someone must have liked it as it sold at the show. Hope they enjoy it. And that it keeps working, but the LEDs are running at very low power so they should last forever.</p>

<p><strong>Sunbeam</strong> was a long time in the making. The inspiritational piece for mewas when I picked up an old Sunbeam brand cake mixer on hard rubbish, and then I dropped it and broke off the handle, which was made of brittle bakelite. I then removed the handle, and the hole in the top looked like a cockpit, with the lovely 50s design of the mixer forming the body of a retro-futuristic vehicle. Somehow a pair of wheels from the nozzle of a garden blower got fitted, and a single trailing wheel that came from a sewing machine.</p>
<p>But there it stalled, as I wanted a figure in the cockpit, and I could never find one&mldr; until years later I found a fairly hideous doll which I&rsquo;m told is a &ldquo;Bratz&rdquo;, and the legs came off and she became a cyborg, a post-human creature. Since I am a fan of Studio Ghibli movies I made a little propellor out of a brass valve because anything can fly if it has a propellor.</p>
<p>I left her sitting on my bench at my shared studio space at Footscray Maker Lab, and Emily the caretaker wandered by. She loved Sunbeam and added her own vision of a leopard print crop top and a hairdo using industrial strength hair lacquer made specially for punks.</p>
<p>Since then Sunbeam has always been around my house, a little ray of sushine with a heart of gold if you can get over the miniature-cyborg-punk-doll vibe.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Emily in her caravan and succulent garden.</p>

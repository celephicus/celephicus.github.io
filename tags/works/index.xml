I made the hull out of abroken upright from a set of Brownbuilt steel shelves, the row of holes where the shelves could be fixed looked to me like portholes. I did get the hull welded up by a professional welder who is also an artist. Claude and I worked on the trimmings on the deck together, using mainly my bits &amp;amp; pieces.</description></item><item><title>I Made It Myself</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/misc/i-made-it-myself/</guid><description>I made I Made It Myself for a recycled art show held in Kingston in 2022. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Messages of Hope&amp;rdquo; and the direction was to make a mailbox. I was rather pleased that I got first prize, heres me &amp;amp; the Mayor Paula Wreidt at the opening.
Materials The box is made of scrap clear acrylic glued together. I have yet to find a good glue for acrylic, even bathroom silicone (the sort that smells like ants) doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold very well.</description></item><item><title>Miss New Zealand</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/miss-new-zealand/</guid><description>Miss New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s name was inspired by the mascot for the Sydney Mardi Gras one year, who was a 1950&amp;rsquo;s young lady in twinset &amp;amp; pearls, who obviously never went out without her coat, hat and gloves.
The starting point was the novelty Harrods branded padlock, it was an obvious handbag. Her body is a trailer plug, arms from a gas lighter and hands are electrical terminals. Her shoes are also some sort of electrical clippy thing.</description></item><item><title>The Reader</title><link>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://redgumandrust.com.au/works/figures/the-reader/</guid><description>The Reader is just made to sit on a shelf and keeps very much to herself (I always think of it as a &amp;ldquo;her&amp;rdquo;). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what shes made of, just some rusty iron I picked up, I do remember being inspired by the wonderful textures that rust gives to iron after a few years or decades.
Her legs are a pair of hinges from an old Singer sewing machine that allowed it to fold away into the wooden base.</description></item></channel></rss>
